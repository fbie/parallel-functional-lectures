# Parallel Functional Programming Lectures #

Code and slides (and code for slides) for four lectures on parallel functional programming in Typed Racket and Java. In the Java world, we will also look at concurrency.

## Lecture 1: Functional Programming in Racket ##

### Content ###

This lecture briefly introduces functional programming in Typed Racket. We want to look at persistent data types, such as classical *cons*-lists and binary trees, and higher-order functional programming, the option type and manual typing.

We will not cover topics such as monads (even though we will look at the *Maybe* type), lenses and function composition in general. Mostly, we want to get familiar with the, to most of you, unfamiliar syntax of Typed Racket.

## Lecture 2: Parallel Computations on Immutable Data Structures ##

#### Content ####

Parallel programming is difficult to get right if there is a lot of mutable state involved. In particular, programmers have to decide in advance how they want to distribute work across the available threads.

With modern thread schedulers and the concept of *Futures* however, we can leave the problem of distributing work to the run-time scheduler. To do so in a functional language, we need to represent arrays in a way that lets us use the scheduler efficiently.

One such way is the *Rope* data structure. A rope is a binary tree with lists (or arrays) at its leaves. In this lecture, we will look at how to define commonly used operations on container types, such as concatenation, ```map```, ```zip``` and ```fold``` and how to parallelize those which can be parallelized.
