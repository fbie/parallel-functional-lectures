# Typing an Untyped Racket Library #

In this project, your task is to chose an untyped library from [the Racket Package Repository](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/) and to provide the types for it. You should annotate the package's source code with the correct types and the Typed Racket type checker should be able to check the program.

Please let me know which package you have chosen in advance, so that I can make sure that the package is not too large for you to type over the course of the project.
